# Evaluation Criteria for the "Website" Assignment

The general requirements are described in [assignment-module-1.md](https://github.com/UCLL-Frontend/oefeningen-frontend-deel1/edit/main/assignment-module-1.md).  
What follows is a brief summary of the evaluation criteria, the aspects we particularly focus on when reviewing your website.

## General

These criteria are binding.

- Your website consists of 4 pages plus a site specification.
- The content (both text and images) and layout of the website must form a consistent and meaningful whole.

## HTML

- All pages must have valid HTML. Validate online via validator.w3.org of html5.validator.nu.
- Your code must demonstrate that you have mastered all the concepts that were taught.
- The semantics of HTML must be correct:
  - You must use structure-defining elements in the correct way (header, article, section, etc.).
  - You must use headings, paragraphs, lists, etc., appropriately.
- You must know the syntax of various form elements. This is the case if your form:
  - Includes a checkbox or radio button.
  - Contains at least three different input types (other than checkbox/radio button and submit).
- Your form must provide HTML5 client-side validation.

## CSS

- The CSS is validated. Only errors caused by nesting are allowed.
- Your code must demonstrate that you have mastered all the concepts that were taught.
- You must be able to use CSS selectors correctly and efficiently:
  - You are familiar with the different types of selectors.
  - You code efficiently by making the right choice of selector.
- You can change the flow of blocks using display:flex. The use must be meaningful.
  - You can demonstrate this by using flex in at least three places.
- You can change the flow of blocks using display:grid. The use must be meaningful.
  - You can demonstrate this by using grid in at least one place.
- You are familiar with other concepts of the box model (e.g., margin, padding, border) and can apply them appropriately and meaningfully.
- Your website is responsive and flexible.
  - As the screen width and height change, the website's usability and readability remain intact.
- You must be able to use media queries meaningfully:
  - You can demonstrate this by providing at least one breakpoint where the layout of different pages significantly changes. Examples: a single-column layout changes to a two-column layout, or an image below text changes to an image next to the text.
  - It is not sufficient if only the navigation changes.
- You can design a form that is usable at different screen widths. The layout is adapted to the other pages of your website.
- You can use CSS variables, at least to globally define the colors.
- You can use CSS nesting: where possible, where useful, and where it improves the readability of the code.

## Additional Points

- The layout is well-adapted: appropriate color usage, well-chosen fonts and font sizes, correct horizontal and vertical alignment, sufficient contrast (CRAP principles).
- The loading speed is acceptable: images are properly compressed.
